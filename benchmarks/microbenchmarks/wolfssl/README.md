## To Set up Intel SGX.
Please refer to `wolfssl-examples/SGX_Linux/README.md` to build up your environment.

Two steps:
1. in `v5.7.0-stable`, find `IDE/LINUX-SGX` and build some related static library.
2. in `wolfssl-examples`, build up the `App` binary and run `-b` to get the benchmarks.

Make sure to run in SIM mode.
